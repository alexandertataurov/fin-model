## Implementation Details

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and strict type checking
- **Build Tool**: Vite with hot module replacement and proxy configuration
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI) with emotion styling
- **Routing**: React Router DOM v6 with nested routing
- **State Management**: Zustand for local state + React Query for server state
- **Charts**: Recharts for financial data visualization
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library with jsdom environment
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier with TypeScript rules

### Backend Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM and Alembic migrations
