# 11 - Finalize Core Modeling Engine

**Purpose:**  
Provide analysts a web platform to ingest spreadsheets, manage parameters, build and compare scenarios, visualize results, and export reports in real time.

## Functional Requirements

- **File Management:** Upload, preview, download, and monitor processing of Excel/CSV files.
- **Parameter Management:** Create, validate, update, batch-edit, and track history of parameters with type, category, and dependency metadata.
- **Scenario Modeling:** Create baseline or derived scenarios, clone/version, edit parameter values, run calculations, and compare scenarios via sensitivity or Monte Carlo analysis.
- **Formula Engine:** Evaluate Excel-style formulas with dependency graphs, auditing, and functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, and MAX.
- **Dashboards:** Present overview metrics (files, parameters, reports) plus P&L, balance sheet, and cash-flow insights with period filters and statement comparisons.
- **Reporting:** Manage report templates, schedule exports, generate PDF/Excel/chart outputs, and track status.
- **Analytics:** Expose processing statistics, file-type distribution, user activity, error analysis, and system performance metrics.
- **Real-Time Updates:** WebSocket channel for file/task progress, notifications, and connection stats.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Registration, login with rate limiting, token issuance, and permission-based access.
- **Frontend Application:** Responsive React SPA with pages for login, file upload, dashboards, scenarios, analytics, and reports using React Router, React Query, and Axios.

**Complexity:** ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 60–80 hours

## Tasks

- Complete implementation of the native financial model builder (sheet/cell structure, CRUD)
- Finalize and optimize the formula engine (Excel compatibility, error handling, circular reference detection)
- Integrate scenario management and parameter adjustment
- Ensure real-time calculation and dependency tracking
- Implement file management (upload, preview, download, processing monitor)
- Build parameter management (create, validate, batch-edit, history tracking)
- Develop scenario modeling (clone, version, compare, sensitivity, Monte Carlo)
- Integrate dashboards for metrics, P&L, balance sheet, cash flow
- Implement reporting (template management, scheduling, export, status tracking)
- Add analytics dashboard (processing stats, file types, user activity, errors, performance)
- Enable real-time updates via WebSocket for progress and notifications
- Ensure authentication and authorization (registration, login, permissions)
- Build responsive frontend SPA with all required pages and navigation

## Acceptance Criteria
