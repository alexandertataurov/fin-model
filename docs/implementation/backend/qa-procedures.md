# Quality Assurance Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA) procedures, quality gates, and testing standards for the FinVision financial modeling application.

## QA Strategy

### Quality Philosophy

- **Quality First**: Quality is everyone's responsibility, not just QA team
- **Shift Left**: Find and fix defects as early as possible in development
- **Continuous Testing**: Integrate testing throughout the development lifecycle
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus testing efforts on high-risk areas
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tests to increase efficiency and coverage

### Quality Goals

- **Zero Critical Defects** in production
- **95%+ Test Coverage** for critical business logic
- **Sub-2 Second Response Time** for key user interactions
- **99.9% Uptime** for production systems
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** for accessibility
- **Zero Security Vulnerabilities** above medium severity
