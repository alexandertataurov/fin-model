# Request for Comments (RFC) Process

Use the RFC process to propose significant design system changes. This document is mirrored on the [internal wiki](https://wiki.internal/FinVision/RFC) for broader visibility.

## When to Submit an RFC
- Introducing or deprecating design tokens.
- Adding new component patterns or altering foundational styles.
- Major accessibility or theming shifts.

## How to Submit
1. Copy the RFC template under `docs/rfcs/` and fill out summary, motivation, detailed design, and alternatives.
2. Open a pull request with the RFC document or create an issue linking to it.
3. Share the draft with the `#design-system` channel for initial feedback.

## Review
- Allow at least five business days for comments from maintainers and designers.
- Incorporate feedback and clearly mark open questions.

## Approval
- Two maintainers, including one design lead, must approve.
- Merge the RFC and reference the approved document in related pull requests.
