# Contributing Guidelines

This guide explains how to contribute to the FinVision project and maintain consistency across the codebase.

## Token Naming
- Prefix design tokens with `fin-` to denote project scope.
- Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names (e.g., `fin-primary-color`).
- Group tokens by category (e.g., color, spacing) for clarity.

## Component Guidelines
- Build components using the defined design tokens.
- Keep components small, focused, and reusable.
- Document new components in the storybook or relevant docs.

## Review Workflow
1. Create a branch for your change.
2. Ensure pre-commit checks and tests pass.
3. Open a pull request and request review.
4. Address feedback and obtain at least one approval before merging.
