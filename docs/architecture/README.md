## Overview

This section contains the foundational architectural documents that define how the financial modeling application is structured, organized, and implemented. These documents are essential for understanding the system's design decisions and technical approach.

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Lean Architecture** - Streamlined, focused on core financial modeling
2. **Modern Stack** - FastAPI backend, React frontend with TypeScript
3. **Performance-Oriented** - Optimized for financial calculations and data processing
4. **Modular Design** - Clear separation between backend services and frontend components

### For Developers

Start with [lean-financial-app-documentation.md](./lean-financial-app-documentation.md) for a complete technical overview.

### For Architects

Review [backend-frontend-comparison.md](./backend-frontend-comparison.md) for system design insights.

### For Product Teams

See [core-financial-modeling-deduplication-summary.md](./core-financial-modeling-deduplication-summary.md) for improvement summaries.
