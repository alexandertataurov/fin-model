# Codex Agent Guidelines

- Use React + TypeScript for frontend
- Use minimal but professional UI (monospaced fonts, clean layout)
- Prefer lightweight libraries over heavy UI kits
- For grid system: start with `ag-grid-community` or `handsontable`
- Follow Airbnb TypeScript styleguide
- Keep code modular and easy to refactor
