# Financial Modeling MVP

React + TypeScript frontend for a simple financial modeling tool.
It features:
- Monospaced fonts
- Clean financial report style layout
- Excel-like grid built with `ag-grid-react`

## Netlify Deployment
Netlify runs `cd frontend && npm run build` and publishes the `frontend/dist` directory.
Because this is a React single-page app, all routes redirect to `index.html`.
