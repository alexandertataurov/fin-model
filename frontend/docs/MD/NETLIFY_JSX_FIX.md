# Netlify JSX Runtime Fix

## Problem

The application was failing on Netlify with the error:

```
TypeError: p.jsxDEV is not a function
```

This error typically occurs due to JSX runtime configuration issues in production builds.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **React Version Mismatch**: React and React DOM had different versions
   - `react`: `^18.3.1`
   - `react-dom`: `^18.2.0`

2. **React Version Conflicts**: Many dependencies were expecting React 19.x, causing version conflicts

3. **Inconsistent JSX Runtime Configuration**: Different Vite configs had varying JSX settings

4. **Missing Explicit JSX Configuration**: The build configs weren't explicitly setting JSX runtime options

## Fixes Applied

### 1. React Version Upgrade

Updated `package.json` to use React 19.x for better compatibility:

```json
{
  "react": "^19.0.0",
  "react-dom": "^19.0.0"
}
```

### 2. Explicit JSX Runtime Configuration

Updated all Vite configs to explicitly set JSX runtime:

**vite.config.ts**:

```typescript
plugins: [
  react({
    jsxRuntime: 'automatic',
    jsxImportSource: 'react',
  }),
],
```

**vite.config.netlify.ts**:

```typescript
plugins: [
  react({
    jsxRuntime: 'automatic',
    jsxImportSource: 'react',
  }),
],
```

**vite.config.netlify.simple.ts**:

```typescript
plugins: [
  react({
    jsxRuntime: 'automatic',
    jsxImportSource: 'react',
  }),
],
```

### 3. Enhanced Build Configuration

Added to `vite.config.netlify.simple.ts`:

- Dependency optimization for React packages
- Manual chunking for React vendor bundle
- Proper environment variable definitions
- Enhanced rollup options

### 4. Build Verification

Created `scripts/verify-build.js` to:

- Verify build integrity
- Check for required bundles
- Validate asset generation
- Ensure proper JSX runtime inclusion

### 5. Netlify Integration

Updated `netlify.toml` to:

- Include build verification in all build commands
- Ensure consistent build process across environments

## Testing

The fix has been tested locally with:

```bash
npm run build:netlify:simple && npm run verify-build
```

✅ Build completes successfully
✅ All required bundles are generated
✅ JSX runtime is properly configured
✅ No JSX-related errors in production build

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always keep React and React DOM versions in sync
2. Use the latest stable React version (currently 19.x) for better compatibility
3. Use explicit JSX runtime configuration in all Vite configs
4. Run build verification before deploying
5. Test production builds locally before pushing to Netlify

## Files Modified

- `package.json` - React version alignment
- `vite.config.ts` - JSX runtime configuration
- `vite.config.netlify.ts` - JSX runtime configuration
- `vite.config.netlify.simple.ts` - Enhanced build config
- `netlify.toml` - Build verification integration
- `scripts/verify-build.js` - Build verification script (new)
