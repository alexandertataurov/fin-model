# Netlify Deployment Debugging Guide

## üö® Issue: Frontend doesn't render anything on Netlify

### Most Likely Causes:

1. **JavaScript errors during initialization**
2. **Missing environment variables**
3. **Overly aggressive build optimizations**
4. **Content Security Policy blocking resources**

## üîß Step-by-Step Debugging:

### Step 1: Check Netlify Build Logs
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Click on your site ‚Üí "Deploys" tab
3. Click on the latest deploy
4. Check for any build errors or warnings

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
1. Open your Netlify site in browser
2. Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab
3. Look for JavaScript errors (red text)
4. Check Network tab for failed requests

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables
In Netlify dashboard ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables:
- `VITE_API_URL` = `https://fin-model-production.up.railway.app`
- `NODE_ENV` = `production`

### Step 4: Use Debug Configuration
Replace your current `netlify.toml` with `netlify.debug.toml`:

```bash
# In your repository root
mv netlify.toml netlify.toml.backup
mv netlify.debug.toml netlify.toml
```

### Step 5: Check Specific Files
1. Verify `/dist/index.html` exists and has the script tag
2. Verify `/dist/assets/` contains JS and CSS files
3. Check if files are actually loading (Network tab)

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Fixes:

### Fix 1: Simplify CSP (Content Security Policy)
Current CSP is very restrictive. The debug config has a more permissive one.

### Fix 2: Reduce Build Optimizations
The current build config is very aggressive:
- Uses ES2022 (too modern for some browsers)  
- Drops all console logs (hides errors)
- Very strict tree-shaking

### Fix 3: Add Error Boundaries
Check if your app has proper error boundaries to catch and display errors.

## üîç Common Error Patterns:

### Pattern 1: White Screen + Console Errors
**Solution**: Fix JavaScript errors shown in console

### Pattern 2: White Screen + No Console Errors  
**Solution**: Check if CSS is loading properly

### Pattern 3: "Cannot read property of undefined"
**Solution**: Check environment variables and API connectivity

### Pattern 4: Module loading errors
**Solution**: Simplify build configuration

## üìû Emergency Rollback:
If you need to quickly fix the site:

1. Use the debug configuration I created
2. Or temporarily use a simpler build:
   ```json
   // In package.json, change:
   "build:netlify": "vite build"
   ```

## üéØ Next Steps:
1. Try the debug configuration first
2. Check browser console for errors  
3. Verify environment variables
4. If still broken, we can simplify further

The debug configuration I created should work better because it:
- Uses more compatible ES2020 target
- Keeps console logs for debugging
- Has less aggressive optimizations
- More permissive security headers
