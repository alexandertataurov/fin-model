# Tokens Pipeline

This design system uses Style Dictionary with tokens defined in the root `tokens/` directory. Running the build script generates outputs in `dist/tokens` that are consumed by components and stories.

## Workflow

- Edit files under `tokens/`
- Generate code: `npm run build:tokens`
- Consume tokens from `@/design-system/tokens`

## Notes

- Typography is normalized to arrays: `[fontSize, { lineHeight }]` in rem.
- Spacing and radius are converted to rem.
- Transitions get an `ease-in-out` curve if not specified.
- CSS variables are supported via either `{":root", ".dark"}` or `{ light, dark }` shapes.

> Do not edit `tokens.ts` directly. It re-exports the generated JSON.
